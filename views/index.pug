      p I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am on track to graduate in May of 2017. I am the IT Specialist, as well as an EMT-Basic at UMass EMS. I am also an Undergraduate Researcher at the Gierasch Lab. My work involves using machine learning techniques to derive folding properties of particular proteins in E. coli. My professional interests include: web development and machine learning. I created this website to serve as a central hub for my various accounts as wel as showcase my experience and the projects I have completed.
